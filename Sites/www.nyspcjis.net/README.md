Information
-----------
This is a car registration lookup website that Dt Abernathy instructs Darlene to use while being chased in episode one.

Well if she can use it - We can use it too!

Since this gives out other ARG clues, there is a dedicated folder to searches and results ![License_Plates](https://github.com/z3r07h/Mr-R0B0T-s03-ARG/tree/master/License_Plates)

To use the website you put the license plate/car number in the LIC field, select the state (only NY and NJ are avaialable) and the year (Years go back to 2000)

**I have heard of someone from ARG society making a bot/script to auto check all combinations of state/year and you just need an LIC number to try, So you should definitely checkout their Subreddit and Discord channel!!** (Credits:)
