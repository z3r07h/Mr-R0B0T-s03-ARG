Information
-----------

This site practically started the ARG for season 3. I was not on it as fast as the guys from ARG society so all respect goes to them for what follows. 

Two new PDFs were discovered before the start of Mr Robot Season 3 episode one airing. Namely **spotthedifference.pdf** and **colorbynumbers.pdf**


Spot The Difference (Credits to ARG Society)
-------------------

Theories regarding the fence posts being binary, also "spot the difference" being a theme for season 3 ARG


Color By Numbers (Credits to ARG Society)
----------------

- Binary theory again for the fence posts
- The Butterfly tail is morse code (NEED THE MORSE TRANSLATION)
- The numbers by the colors represent alphabet letters
- The Sun ends up spelling "SHES NOT SANE" when converted from colors to alphabet


TODO
----
- Get Images of the PDFs for this page
- Find out what the morse code is
- Find out if the Sun word was an anagram
- Credit first solvers properly
