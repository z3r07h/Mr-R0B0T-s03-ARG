Preface
-------

WOOO BOY was there ALOT in this episode that could be ARG related, and I mean alot. The first 10 minutes had an incredible amount of information in it. I've done my best to record as much relevant information as possible. Once I've finished this write up I will check in with the ARGSociety and see what I may have missed. 

This write up take a bit of a different turn than the first episode, which will be backported when I have some time. 
Firstly we'll start with the observations and follow that with screencaps from the episode to back them up. In addition, timestamps are included in case anyone wants to look them up in the episode, bear in mind the time for each viewer may be slightly different. 
You can also find all the screencaps (if needed) in the images folders. Special thanks to ColonelDox for their input, extra info  and double checking.

Preliminary Stuff from previous episodes
----------------------------------------
- 17 of 71 Facilities "This is where the paper records are going"
- Blueprints of the 'Evil' corp facility
- Facility 511 (Ground Floor)
- The manual being read is **ups_sumx640-service-manual**
- Elliot connects to (the femtocell) via **l4713116.e-corp.usa.com** (NB This link no longer seems to exist and simply redirects to www.usa.com)


Episode 2 Observations
----------------------

- (01:22) E-corp are setting up/have various other companies such as in the previous episode we saw e-corp estates, in this episode we see e-corp insurance
- (01:30) "Your Trash For 2 E-coin" 
- (01:40) E-corp building number is 901
- (01:45) We first see Elliots ID card and the **QR code** on it - we will see this card 4 times in the next sequence however one of those times the card is face up (3rd time) and all the others it is upside down
- (02:36) **https://www.trunkclub.com** - looks like a legit website, need to double check if it's part of the ARG or not
- (xx:xx) Poster advert for **"FALLERE"** on the tube
- (03:04) We see Elliot entering his e-corp password, it looks like it at least has the letters N and Y in it. It may be possible to do some statistical analysis on what looks like are the keys entered. However we see Elliots asterixed password several times this episode, and by the final time it looks like his password is 23 characters long, statistical analysis may not help unless we can observe a very large majority of it. In addition, it could be a common phrase, or something related to the show (e.g. fiveNinehacksoleet1337ynot?. Jury is currently out on this one. 
- (xx:xx) **l223u** -Elliot's desktop reveals a list of files, on the left hand side there is a network drive mapped with a username l223u
- (xx:xx) **BKNAPPLE** **ARGSociety Shout out** - his name is listed on the bottom file inside Elliot's "Recovery Effort" folder
- (03:14) **Full Ecorp address** revealed as **"901 E 57th Street, New York New York, 10022, Phone number (212)-555-0171** (This is a dead end street on google maps - https://goo.gl/maps/z2iB98xCwY92)
- (03:17) "Primo poon" is on the **31st Floor** - this can be linked to the Reddit posts found on 'inside_e_corp' subreddit, and we should be able to directly attribute the on-screen character to the username that posted a similar comment. 
- (03:23) **Map** of E-corp Active US Storage Facilities - links to map theory/Geological stuff being a big impact in this seasons ARG.
- (03:56) **E-corp Employee Heirarchy** (at least for Elliots Department) 
- (04:18) **William Braddock details**: **william.braddock@e-corp-usa.com | aboynamedg00 | https://webmail.e-corp-usa.com/OWA** 
- (04:18) Tool "credential harvester" used to collect Braddock's details. I believe this is from SET (social engineers toolkit) which has been used previousl by Darlene and her munchkins in season 2. In case you're wondering where it is, run SET then choose options 1 (Social engineering attacks), 2 (Webiste attack Vectors), 3 (Credential Harvester Attack Method) - DISCLAIMER, I am not advocating the use of this software for anything other than legal ethical hacking, red-teaming, or personal education. 
- (04:21) List of William Braddocks inbox - For full names and email address please refer to subfolder
- (04:21) **HI COLIN** Ticketmaster email to William Braddock about his 'Goo Goo Dolls' tickets - so looks like either a) he uses a different login for ticketmaster OR b) someone else forwarded him on the tickets. 
- (04:21) One of the emails states that there will be 'Server Maintenance' next week
- (04:31) The picture behind Braddocks desk looks pretty odd, could possibly be some sort of <> cipher? 
- (04:33) The woman with the FBI from e-corp looks to be **Robyn/Bobby Fulltern** Not sure if her QR code can enhanced like Elliots. 
- (04:55) **e-corp-ua.com/cpl directory/shipping/108898** website for the e-corp logistics
- (xx:xx) EARL the driver states that he has come to "SU FALLS" (??) South Dakota
- (05:58) **PETER MCCLEEREY password **tapitback!** 
- (06:38) **ts1.e-corp-usa.com** looks like a production server for uploading new software to e-corp hardware
- (06:56) Assembly code for unit **apc_hw05** - personally I don't believe there's enough of this code to compile - there's a chance the hex on the right hand side has something hidden in it. I'll keep my ear to the ground but at the moment there's so many other things to investigate that I won't be trying to decode a bunch of stuff that looks legitimate. 
- (xx:xx) **K6F7241 - FTPplugin**
- (xx:xx) **$73 million** the amount of money E-corp looks to save if they followed Elliot's recovery plan. Is that 73 million in this new age of the dollar becoming worthless? cos that probably wouldn't even buy 5 apples in 6 months time. ;)
- (07:15) Elliots QR code/Id Badge upright
- (xx:xx) "Apples 3 for $25 or 5 e-coin"
- (07:57) Elliots Password looks to be 21 characters long
- (08:01) Elliots Password looks to be 23 characters long
- (xx:xx) **r/Inside_Evil_Corp** subreddit, howwever it's apparent that it's only through Elliot's eyes does the 'e' in 'e-corp' turn to 'evil' 
- (xx:xx) **217 Broadway, tel - 212-673-7260** Chinese restaurant address next to Elliot's apartment - This has probably been noticed several times before, the phone number doesn't have the classic "555" in the middle, so this could be a legit phone number/actual building. 
- (xx:xx) **207 Broadway** Elliot's address, for completeness his apartment number is 4E. 
- (09:48) Continuity easter egg? Is Elliot Crying in the exact same place that he was in season 1 episode 1 ?
- (10:04) Elliot gets his prescription from "Essex Street Pharmacy"

Phew that's the start of th episode complete. 
Let's see what else is in there!

- (18:29) **Vimeo Account** Lonely FBI lady states that the NEW FSociety video has been posted to the same Vimeo account as the previous ones. 
- (19:57) Blurry shot of the FBI laptop screen
- (20:02) A Couple of interesting **files on the FBI laptop** (add filenames)
- (21:12) **H4G-B5FG** (could be O instead of G) Joanna Wellick's lover's (Derek) car registration looks like
- (xx:xx) **NUQ-1724** Joanna Wellick's car registration plate, it's a New York number plate, and her car is a 'surburban' model
- (23:58) Blood on the babies head, I have certainly not screencapped this as I definitely do not think there is any secret code, or symbol being put there. 1) I don't think the producers would want us using that as a reference point or having to stare at it for hours on end to work it out, 2) I think it would be extremely difficult and time consuming to get a baby to stay still long enough to put a symbol in blood on it's head and make it look like a legitimate blood splatter at the same time.
- (38:13) "A Civilisation that leaves so many of it's citizens unsatisfied and drives them into revolt... " Einsten quote read by MR ROBOT 
- (xx:xx) **TERS THIS FALL** These are the only letters visible from the "Separation Anxiety" film poster that Elliot is sitting in front of on the metro.
- (xx:xx) **20:46** The time on Elliot's computer
- (42:55) tool **cnc_receiver.py** being utilised by the FBI to take screenshots of Elliots desktop 
- (44:01) White Rose Aide talks about the Congo "Lua al" Mine
- (44:44) **HRC-1362**  Car registration plate parked outside the FBI stakeout house
- (45:13) **DOJ_9431** Doj number of FBI laptop
- (xx:xx) "Imported Kamora Coffee Liquer" on Dom's mug
- (xx:xx) **08:01** Time on Elliots computer
- (45:24) **ThePlague@ukev0hfruxcqvjst1c.net**
- (45:24) **eugenebelford@q09orkldvfvsqq.net**
- (xx:xx) Although the previous two emails are .net addresses they look kinda like.onion addresses
- (45:30)**sandbox.vflsruxm.net/plans.rar** rar file Elliot uses to lure FBI into opening 
- (46:16) The PGP'd version of Elliots email - This definitely doesn't come from the files listed and as it is in it's orginal format is not a valid PGP Message. Why? Because...
- (46:16) **CRAMBO** , **BESKONE**, **CARNAGEINCARNATE** from **ARGSocity** reddit names in the PGP message

Well that was a lot. Lets go have some fun with it all!


Extra Interesting Stuff
-----------------------

Reddit names from people that contributed greatly to solving the ARG from season 2 were seen in this episode. Check notes above, or pictures below for confirmation. 

Namely -  BKNAPPLE, CRAMBO, BESKONE, & CARNAGEINCARNATE (in that order)

Elliots Birthday is mentioned in this episode,  we can try and pinpoint what date it is from various emails that have timestamps e.g. Peter MCcleerey's email dated August 4th 2015, and from the timestamps the FBI pictures are using while they monitor him.

Currently we can place Elliots birthday at least between August 4th - 18th September. (needs more work)
